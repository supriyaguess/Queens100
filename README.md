# Queens Puzzle Game

A browser-based implementation of the Queens Puzzle Game using ReactJS.

## Game Rules

1. The grid is NÃ—N (e.g., 7Ã—7 or 9Ã—9).
2. Each cell may belong to a colored region.
3. The goal is to place **exactly one queen** (`â™›`):
   * in every **row**
   * in every **column**
   * in every **colored region**
4. **Queens cannot touch** each other â€” not even diagonally.
5. The player taps to place/remove a queen or right-clicks to mark a blocked spot (like a flag or 'X').
6. Once the grid is solved correctly, the player can see a "ðŸŽ‰ Puzzle Solved!" message.
